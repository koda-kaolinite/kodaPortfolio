  Hello, I'm **Koda Turqui**, a **Software Engineer** and **Fullstack Developer** based here in SÃ£o Paulo. In recent years, I've been immersed in the world of software development, focusing on building systems that are not only functional, but genuinely robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

  My journey began with a solid foundation in hardware, which gave me a deep appreciation for logic and problem-solving. This passion evolved into software, leading me to pursue degrees in **Systems Analysis and Development** and **Software Engineering**, as well as intensive programs like **Oracle Next Education**, **Santander Academy**, and **Serasa Transforme-se**. That's where I discovered my calling to work with people and code. Since then, I've been honing my skills in both areas, believing that the best digital products are born from a balance between understanding engineering and experience.

  ### My Way of Working
  I firmly believe that software is a collective discipline: **it's people, working with people, to serve other people**. My role in a project goes beyond writing code; it's about listening, communicating, and building consensus. I seek to create an environment where everyone's ideas are valued and where collaboration flows naturally, because the best solutions are born from collective intelligence.

  My technical knowledge is an instrument to translate visions into reality in a clear and sustainable way. I prioritize creating systems that are easy for other developers to understand and maintain, because good teamwork endures over time.

  ### What Motivates Me
  What truly inspires me is the moment when someone uses a tool I helped build and feels their life has become a little simpler. It's seeing the collaborative effort of a team transform into a smile, a problem solved, or a goal achieved by someone on the other end. This connection and personal fulfillment is the greatest reward of my work.

  ### Beyond the Code
  Outside of the computer, I like to relax by taking care of my plants and my pets. I also love doing manual work, such as knitting, crocheting, and cooking.
