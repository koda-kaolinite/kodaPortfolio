  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    As a Software Engineer and full-stack developer for 4 years, and supported by my continuous training, I design and develop complete end-to-end web solutions, transforming business requirements into functional, scalable, and easily maintainable systems.

    I apply Architecture and Design principles to create systems that are not only functional, but also scalable, testable, and easy to maintain. I believe that a well-architected system is the foundation for an exceptional user experience, and I work throughout the entire lifecycle to ensure this synergy.

  categories:
    - title: Services & Process
      questions:
        - label: What services do you offer?
          content: |
            My specialty is end-to-end software development, with a focus on systems and web applications. My services include API design, building robust and scalable back-ends (mainly with Java/Spring and Nest.js), and developing reactive front-ends. I work from architecture design to deployment.
        - label: What is your development process like?
          content: |
            My process is guided by agile methodologies and focused on the quality of delivery, not only considering the technique, but also the trade-offs of each decision. It usually involves stages such as Requirements Analysis, Solution Architecture (following principles like DDD and Hexagonal Architecture), test-driven development, Code Review, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). I adapt the process to ensure the delivery of functional, testable, and easily maintainable software.
        - label: Do you work with startups?
          content: |
            Yes, absolutely. I am very interested in working with startups to help define the technical foundation of their products. My experience allows me to build robust MVPs (Minimum Viable Product) and design architectures that can scale as the business grows, adapting to the fast-paced development environment.
    - title: "Pricing & Timelines"
      questions:
        - label: How much does a project typically cost?
          content: |
            Costs vary based on scope, complexity, features, and timeline. For full web application development projects, my contracts usually start at R$15,000, with average projects ranging between R$20,000 and R$40,000. For architecture consulting or specific development tasks, my daily rate is R$500.
        - label: What are your payment terms?
          content: |
            I generally require a 40% deposit to schedule the project and begin work, with the remaining 60% due upon successful project completion and delivery. I accept payments via bank transfer and Pix.
        - label: How long does a typical project take?
          content: |
            Timelines depend heavily on the project's scope and technical complexity. Smaller projects, like an MVP, can take 4 to 6 weeks, while larger, more involved projects can range from 2 to 5 months. I always provide a detailed timeline estimate after the initial scope analysis phase.
        - label: Do you offer retainers or ongoing support?
          content: |
            Yes, for clients who need ongoing technical support, product evolution, or systems maintenance, I offer monthly retainer options tailored to specific needs. Let's talk if this is something you're interested in.
    - title: "About Me"
      questions:
        - label: "What do you enjoy most about your work?"
          content: |
            I am motivated by the challenge of solving complex problems with clean code and well-defined architectures. It is incredibly rewarding to build a robust system that not only works, but is also scalable, testable, and easy to maintain. The elegance in solving a technical challenge is what really drives me, as I know a well-architected system translates into a reliable, high-performance final product for the client.
        - label: "What are your hobbies outside of work?"
          content: |
            When I'm not programming, I enjoy exploring the neighborhoods of São Paulo, trying new coffee shops, and hiking in the nearby parks. I am also a photography enthusiast and actively contribute to open-source projects in my spare time.
